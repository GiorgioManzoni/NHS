Prakash project

007 is the file that use the txt file created by 006 and do all the games with avarage properties of babies. It doesn't go through the class baby but just use the average properties saved in the txt file.

009 Counting object easily from the txt table with the average properties. Very useful to fill table 2 and 3 of Prakash's final analysis. And the last table on perfusion index as well. In this notebook I also create my definition of median and percentile.

011 Plot for the final analysis Prakash's document. I first analyse the difference between mean and median. I double check the 11 babies with mean minus median greater then 10 (more on this in notebook 013) and I finally do some final plots for the paper. Including box plots.
